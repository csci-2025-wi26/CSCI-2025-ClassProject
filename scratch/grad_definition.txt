use person_xper_grad_term
- note: xper does *not* mean expected, it's a database identifier

if there's NA in grad_term and year in grad_academic_year, then add value in column from grad_year

does double value in grad_term mean pushed grad date back? no, graduate student year

if grad, look at year grad, go back three to four years:
we can assume that four years
# of semesters


outcome: switched majors? is that related to performance?
