use person_xper_grad_term
- note: xper does *not* mean expected, it's a database identifier

if there's NA in grad_term and year in grad_academic_year, then add value in column from grad_year

does double value in grad_term mean pushed grad date back? no, graduate student year

if grad, look at year grad, go back three to four years:
we can assume that four years
# of semesters


outcome: switched majors? is that related to performance?

columns we need:
- dfw # t/f or d/f/w/p 
- grad_year
- class_standing
- grad_time # how many years to graduation?
- did go on to graduate school here?
