# 1.1 INTRODUCTION 

As a class, we are developing an application designed to help faculty better understand equity in student outcomes. Our performance group is responsible for creating an interactive tab that allows users to explore DFW rates and GPA across selected student groups. For this component, we used student IDs, assigned letter grades based on students’ GPAs, and created a new variable to represent course level and DFW rate. This course level variable follows a three-digit format, enabling users to filter and compare results by course level. We tested this column and confirmed that it contains no missing (NA) values, ensuring the reliability of the filtering functionality.  buiunk
